This phone is amazing for the price!!!",17/03/2024,"I love this phone! What else can I say. It has a nice big screen, plenty of storage space which you can expand with a micro SD card. I can move between apps very quickly as the phone has plenty of power to run what I need to. I love the fingerprint reader which allows me to log into some of my apps by just holding my thumb onto the right side power button. It also has face recognition. I have only ever had Samsung Android phones in the past and this is my first Motorola phone. I like the way it works better than the Samsung. Everything is just intuitive and very easy to get along with. For text message codes, it lets you copy the code in the notification or it will auto-capture the code so you can just paste it into the app you need to. With my Samsung phones, that feature was always hit or miss. The camera is great and captures great images and video. Even the front facing camera is great quality and you can get nice selfies on it. Definitely make sure you grab a case for it and I would also recommend a glass screen protector. I can't believe how inexpensive this phone was for how great it is. I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone. Oh and did I mention it's 5G capable?! Amazing!

Did not include the promised 10w charger",25/03/2024,"*Update* I decided to revise my review and stars based on the actual phone build and performance. Just keep in mind that you may not receive a charging block, only a cable.After setting the up the phone and using it, I think this phone is a really great value. It looks great and performance is very good for this price point. The only thing that could have been a little better is the display, but this display is pretty good.The camera is very good. I've had a lot of phones over the years from many different manufacturers. This phone has one of the best cameras I've had. I have not tried the macro camera yet though.I also wanted to mention that Motorola did eventually push out the promised Android 14 upgrade after a few days along with security updates. Nice.The phone performs well and the Wi-Fi and 5G work well and are faster than my prior phone. The Bluetooth has better range than my other phones, so I can move around with headphones or earbuds without having to keep the phone with me.The bottom line is, I would definitely recommend this phone. I am not disappointed. In fact, for the price I am impressed.

Still going strong.",04/12/2023,"The information below still holds true.  However, after several weeks with this phone, I actually like it better than my Samsung A54.  When the screen is locked and off, you get these little information dots.  Based on the dot symbol, I can tell whether it is a text from someone, or just a notification from an app.I can touch the little dot symbol, it will give me a little bit of information.  I can swipe from that dot, to dismiss, close out or respond.  I like that.  Lastly, I have noticed the battery life is better than the Samsung A54.  Not fantastic like my old Moto G Power, that would last three days easily, without needing a charge.  But, this one last about 20% longer than the Samsung A54.  Other than that, both phones (the Samsung A54 works just fine), are pretty good for the price.-------------This is an early review of the Moto G Power 5g-2023 model.  Just got it yesterday.First, I have a Samsung A54, that I purchased least Christmas season and it works fine.  No broken screen, no scratches.  But the battery life on it (the A54) did not impress my at all.  Felt the same about the Nord 10, which also is in perfect working condition.Realized that I had been spoiled.  By my 4 or 5 year old, Moto G Power 2019 or 2020 phone.  I could easily go three days, without having to worry about constantly looking at the battery state, with normal use.Yes, it still works, too!  Oh yes, I wanted a headphone jack again, which the Samsung doesn't have.Yes, I have blue tooth headphones (not earbuds), but a set of good corded earbuds, is easy to take out of your pocket and pop into your eye, when you are mobile.So getting the new Moto G Power 5g 2023, at $200 was what I was waiting for.  Here's what I have noticed:a. The screen is cleaner and brighter than my Samsung A54, at a lower setting.b. It is actually a little taller and thinner than my Samsung A54, and not at wide.  So it is easier to hold in my hands.c. Charging time is similar when I put them on two chargers of the same brand, type and wattage.d. The front facing camera lens hole is definitely wider on the Moto G, I barely notice it on the Samsung.e. Setup was very easy. I connected a USB-C, cord between the Samsung and Moto G, and all of my account information was transferred.  I could select NOT to transfer media from the old phone to the new one, since I had inserted, a micro sd slot into the new phone, with what media I always wanted to keep.f. The fingerprint reader is on the side of the phone, vs, in the screen like the Samsung.  Which I actually prefer.Here are the disappointments:1. This phone is newer than the Samsung A54.  Yet, when I did the Geek bench Test series on it, the final results were that the Moto G Power 2023 is about 20% 'slower' than the Samsung.  Oh, according to Geek Bench, they have the same processor.2. I'm only seeing a slightly better battery performance than the Samsung, which is very disappointing, because of the POWER name, that is slapped on it.  Definitely no where close to the battery longevity of my old Moto G Power 4g.3. When I tested the wifi speed, the Samsung A54, downloaded faster, by about 20%.4. This might be user error.  But I can't figure out how to get 5 app icons in a row, compared to my other phones.  The Samsung gives me a grid option, in home screen settings.  But I do not see that in the menu of the Moto G Power 2023, even though they 'both' have Android 13.Yes, I know 5g drains the battery faster than 4g, when all things are the same.  I didn't expect it to quite match my old Moto G Power.  But I was extrapolating that it would be at least 30% better than the competing Samsung A54, which last about a day, before I have to recharge it.  It seems 10% at best of an improvement.So if you have a Samsung A54, and you are looking for performance improvement, I would not buy this phone.BUT, if you have an older phone, like the Samsung A52 (which I had traded in for the Samsung A54), this is definitely a good upgrade at this price, since it was originally about $299.  Especially, if you don't want to have to be bothered with wireless headphones, or fancy 'tiny' wireless earbuds, whose batteries, barely last a few hours.Perception-Someone with 'wired' earbuds walking around in public, are because of industry image,  perceived as cheap.  That is the image that I want.Will I return them?  Nope, too much hassle and they do give me the headphone jack, that I wanted.  But I know that POWER meaning of the past phones, is not the POWER meaning of the newer ones.Attached photo, sorry about it being sideway.

Great Value",22/03/2024,"I've been a Moto fan since 2015. I decided to never spend more than 300 bucks on something that could potentially get replaced in 2-3 years. The gestures are especially great of you're into IT. The shake gesture to turn on the flashlight is clutch, and the phone is very durable and reasonable snappy while providing an adequate duration of use between charges

Very nice budget phone",21/03/2024,"This is my 3rd moto phone. They all are generally the same - reliable, simple, basic phones. This one has notably brighter screen among all previous models. Camera is OK. Phone settings become progressively more complicated, so you need more time to get what you want. Or just forget it and use what they want.

I've had no issues crossing the border into the US. The camera works for my purposes and the Moto gestures are a great feature. The hatchet move to turn the flashlight on is used often as well as the rotate to start the camera.The only reason I replace these phones is the battery, like all phones they tend to lose their staying power after 3 years.

Very nice budget phone",21/03/2024,"This is my 3rd moto phone. They all are generally the same - reliable, simple, basic phones. This one has notably brighter screen among all previous models. Camera is OK. Phone settings become progressively more complicated, so you need more time to get what you want. Or just forget it and use what they want.

This phone is amazing for the price!!!",17/03/2024,"I love this phone! What else can I say. It has a nice big screen, plenty of storage space which you can expand with a micro SD card. I can move between apps very quickly as the phone has plenty of power to run what I need to. I love the fingerprint reader which allows me to log into some of my apps by just holding my thumb onto the right side power button. It also has face recognition. I have only ever had Samsung Android phones in the past and this is my first Motorola phone. I like the way it works better than the Samsung. Everything is just intuitive and very easy to get along with. For text message codes, it lets you copy the code in the notification or it will auto-capture the code so you can just paste it into the app you need to. With my Samsung phones, that feature was always hit or miss. The camera is great and captures great images and video. Even the front facing camera is great quality and you can get nice selfies on it. Definitely make sure you grab a case for it and I would also recommend a glass screen protector. I can't believe how inexpensive this phone was for how great it is. I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone. Oh and did I mention it's 5G capable?! Amazing!

Did not include the promised 10w charger",25/03/2024,"*Update* I decided to revise my review and stars based on the actual phone build and performance. Just keep in mind that you may not receive a charging block, only a cable.After setting the up the phone and using it, I think this phone is a really great value. It looks great and performance is very good for this price point. The only thing that could have been a little better is the display, but this display is pretty good.The camera is very good. I've had a lot of phones over the years from many different manufacturers. This phone has one of the best cameras I've had. I have not tried the macro camera yet though.I also wanted to mention that Motorola did eventually push out the promised Android 14 upgrade after a few days along with security updates. Nice.The phone performs well and the Wi-Fi and 5G work well and are faster than my prior phone. The Bluetooth has better range than my other phones, so I can move around with headphones or earbuds without having to keep the phone with me.The bottom line is, I would definitely recommend this phone. I am not disappointed. In fact, for the price I am impressed.

Still going strong.",04/12/2023,"The information below still holds true.  However, after several weeks with this phone, I actually like it better than my Samsung A54.  When the screen is locked and off, you get these little information dots.  Based on the dot symbol, I can tell whether it is a text from someone, or just a notification from an app.I can touch the little dot symbol, it will give me a little bit of information.  I can swipe from that dot, to dismiss, close out or respond.  I like that.  Lastly, I have noticed the battery life is better than the Samsung A54.  Not fantastic like my old Moto G Power, that would last three days easily, without needing a charge.  But, this one last about 20% longer than the Samsung A54.  Other than that, both phones (the Samsung A54 works just fine), are pretty good for the price.-------------This is an early review of the Moto G Power 5g-2023 model.  Just got it yesterday.First, I have a Samsung A54, that I purchased least Christmas season and it works fine.  No broken screen, no scratches.  But the battery life on it (the A54) did not impress my at all.  Felt the same about the Nord 10, which also is in perfect working condition.Realized that I had been spoiled.  By my 4 or 5 year old, Moto G Power 2019 or 2020 phone.  I could easily go three days, without having to worry about constantly looking at the battery state, with normal use.Yes, it still works, too!  Oh yes, I wanted a headphone jack again, which the Samsung doesn't have.Yes, I have blue tooth headphones (not earbuds), but a set of good corded earbuds, is easy to take out of your pocket and pop into your eye, when you are mobile.So getting the new Moto G Power 5g 2023, at $200 was what I was waiting for.  Here's what I have noticed:a. The screen is cleaner and brighter than my Samsung A54, at a lower setting.b. It is actually a little taller and thinner than my Samsung A54, and not at wide.  So it is easier to hold in my hands.c. Charging time is similar when I put them on two chargers of the same brand, type and wattage.d. The front facing camera lens hole is definitely wider on the Moto G, I barely notice it on the Samsung.e. Setup was very easy. I connected a USB-C, cord between the Samsung and Moto G, and all of my account information was transferred.  I could select NOT to transfer media from the old phone to the new one, since I had inserted, a micro sd slot into the new phone, with what media I always wanted to keep.f. The fingerprint reader is on the side of the phone, vs, in the screen like the Samsung.  Which I actually prefer.Here are the disappointments:1. This phone is newer than the Samsung A54.  Yet, when I did the Geek bench Test series on it, the final results were that the Moto G Power 2023 is about 20% 'slower' than the Samsung.  Oh, according to Geek Bench, they have the same processor.2. I'm only seeing a slightly better battery performance than the Samsung, which is very disappointing, because of the POWER name, that is slapped on it.  Definitely no where close to the battery longevity of my old Moto G Power 4g.3. When I tested the wifi speed, the Samsung A54, downloaded faster, by about 20%.4. This might be user error.  But I can't figure out how to get 5 app icons in a row, compared to my other phones.  The Samsung gives me a grid option, in home screen settings.  But I do not see that in the menu of the Moto G Power 2023, even though they 'both' have Android 13.Yes, I know 5g drains the battery faster than 4g, when all things are the same.  I didn't expect it to quite match my old Moto G Power.  But I was extrapolating that it would be at least 30% better than the competing Samsung A54, which last about a day, before I have to recharge it.  It seems 10% at best of an improvement.So if you have a Samsung A54, and you are looking for performance improvement, I would not buy this phone.BUT, if you have an older phone, like the Samsung A52 (which I had traded in for the Samsung A54), this is definitely a good upgrade at this price, since it was originally about $299.  Especially, if you don't want to have to be bothered with wireless headphones, or fancy 'tiny' wireless earbuds, whose batteries, barely last a few hours.Perception-Someone with 'wired' earbuds walking around in public, are because of industry image,  perceived as cheap.  That is the image that I want.Will I return them?  Nope, too much hassle and they do give me the headphone jack, that I wanted.  But I know that POWER meaning of the past phones, is not the POWER meaning of the newer ones.Attached photo, sorry about it being sideway.  The Nord plus phone is at the top (different wallpaper), the Samsung is in the middle and the Moto G Power at the bottom.  Same wallpaper because it copied over in the transfer.That's it.
